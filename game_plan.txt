grid based world
mobs/NPCs cannot overlap

player moving from one tile to another consumes an action
player attacking consumes an action
player turning direction DOES NOT consume an action
accessing and using the menu for anything DOES NOT consume an action
speaking to NPCs DOES NOT consume an action

mobs moving from one tile to another consumes an action
mobs attacking consumes an action

each iteration of the game loop adds one action point to each mob
as long as a mob has more action points than its energy cost, it acts
mobs will only act when within ACTION_RANGE (some constant) of the player
mobs are only visible when in the player's FOV (?)
background is always visible (?)

events stored in queue
each event is a sequence of functions & params to execute
the event itself is also passed as a param to the function
per game loop, each active event, if ready to continue, executes its next-up function
an event can also start an event immediately (adding to list of active events)

active tween effects are stored in a queue as well

e.g. 1 event carrying out 2 simultaneous animations:
[
lock, ()
queue_tween, (sprite1, target1_1, duration1_1, 't1_1')
queue_tween, (sprite2, target2_1, duration2_1, 't2_1')
await_tween, ('t1_1')
await_tween, ('t2_1')
do_damage, (sprite1, 10)
unlock, ()
]

gamestates are in a stack rendered bottom-up, updated top-down
